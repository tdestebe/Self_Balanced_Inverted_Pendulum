# Self_Balanced_Inverted_Pendulum

Self Balanced Inverted Pendulum

This project aims to build an inverted pendulum stabilized by a single reaction wheel. The position of the pendulum is detected by a 3-axis analog gyroscope sensor (MPU6050 module). The position is analyzed inside an Arduino Uno that sends appropriate signals to a motor (Nidec 24H404H160). 

The assembly of the CAD models and parts are designed with FreeCAD. Following worbenchs are used:

- **Part design** to design 3D mechanical parts

- **Assembly 4.1** based on local axis systems

- **Fasteners** for all screws and nuts

- **Mesh** to create and export STL files
